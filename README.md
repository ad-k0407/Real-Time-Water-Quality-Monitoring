# Real-Time-Water-Quality-Monitoring
Rivers in India cut across cities and towns making them most vulnerable to water pollution. Rivers along with their canals are directly affected by industrial and domestic wastes. This has resulted in making Indiaâ€™s surface water polluted by 80% according to the latest assessment by WaterAid, an international organisation working for water sanitation and hygiene. For a nation where agriculture holds a majority, the determination of water quality is paramount to determine the quality of life. Traditional methods of water quality monitoring cannot bring the results we wish on a minute, time-sensitive scale. When it comes to the ecosystems supported by water bodies, minute changes over a long period might trigger large-scale changes. Moreover, the presence of industries by water bodies further increases the risk of contamination by foreign elements, some of which may not be detected until they cause harm on a large scale, as seen in Flint, Michigan, in the USA. Attempting to use technologies such as cloud computing to bring this data forward in a method that is easily understood, and that collects data over a while to show varying changes in water quality over time is something that this project attempted.
